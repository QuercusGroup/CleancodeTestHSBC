Assumptions:
1. To borrow book, all the input fields for all objects in request are mandatory.
2. To borrow/rent a book, we need to follow below steps -
	1. User should be created who wants to borrow a book
		Sample request:
			url: http://localhost:9080/api/user - POST
			Body: 
				{
			        "userid": "109",
			        "name": "Billy",
			        "address": "NY, USA"
			    }
	2. Book should be created to borrow.
		Sample request:
			url: http://localhost:9080/api/book - POST
			Body: 
				{
				    "isbn": "106",
				    "title": "The Darkest Evening",
				    "author": "Ann Cleeves",
				    "publisher": "Pan Books",
				    "status": "Available"
				}
	3. Now user should call borrow book end point and provide user, book and duration of rent details.
		Sample request:
			url: http://localhost:9080/api/borrow-book - POST
			Body: 
				{
				    "id": 1,
				    "isbn": "101",
				    "userId": "1001",
				    "borrowDate": "2021-03-31",
				    "returnDate": "2021-04-30"
				} 
		Sample request to return book:
			url: http://localhost:9080/api/return-book/{isbn}/{userID} - POST

3. To return a book, user needs to call return book endpoint with user and book details.
4. The service will start on port 9080.
5. Sample data for books and users is inserted at the time of application startup.
6. In memory H2 database is used to store data in this application.
7. Swagger url - http://localhost:9080/swagger-ui.html this url can be used to refer the end points and their sample request responses.
